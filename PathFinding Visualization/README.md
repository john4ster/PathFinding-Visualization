# PathFinding Visualization
A Java program that provides a visualization of the A* PathFinding Algorithm. The user can set a start node, an end node, and draw walls between them and have the algorithm find the fastest path between the two nodes if a path is available.

# How to use
To use the application, place a start node, and end node, and some walls in between. The start node is dark blue, the end node is red, and the walls are black.

##### Placing and Removing Nodes
* Hit the S key to place the start node, this is where the algorithm starts
* Hit the E key to place the end node, this is where the algorithm is trying to get to
* Hitting the S or E key on a different position will override the previous position. There can only be one of each

##### Placing and Removing Walls
* Holding and dragging left mouse places walls
* Holding and dragging right mouse removes walls

##### Running the Algorithm
* When you're ready to run the algorithm, press space bar and it will try to find a path
